# Luxe-Laundry-Ordering-and-Logistics-System-Project.
This project was created for Luxe Laundry to solve their problem with logistics and ordering system that would unsure proper checks are made at all points throughout the ordering and wash process.

Problem Luxe Laudry is facing: When a customerr requests a wash order for x amout of linin. therre are currently a numberr of checks and confirmations that happen only sporadically. this can results in the following types of problems.

1) Customer requests 40 towels to be washed but only suplies 37 towels, becuase the amout of towels supplied by cusomemer is not checked, we send 40 back as per the order at the cost of 3 towels on Luxe Laundry.
2) Reject linin is where it has been spolit to such an extend that it cannot be properly cleaned, therefore, this should be rejected by Luxe at an additional cost of the customer. These are not checked on arrival, revenue is lost where we cannot provide the origin of spolit linin. 

Solution to their problem: Luxe would like to a logistics and orderring system that ensures proper checks happen at all points throughout the ordering and wash process with key specifications:

1) The system can be accessed via an application from a tablet or smartphone or accessed via a destop for ease at customer discretion.
2) the system provided two way authentication checks ffrrom Luxe and customer at the following stages of ordering:
      a. Number of items send to luxe.
      b. reject laundry checked as unloaded.
      c. number of items send from luxe back to customer. 
3) the app must provide status of order: 
      a. order placed(number of items conffirmed by both parties. 
      b. order collention, an estimated date and time of collection.
      c. pre wash check where rejected laundry will be indentified and pictues will be uploaded
      d. when the laudry has been put into wash.
      e. when the laudry will be retured with estimated date and time.
4)	Personal log ins for each organization. With varying permission levels.
      a.	Delivery driver can confirm when order collected and delivered but not washers for example.
5)	Ability to maintain order history for each customer:
      a.	By including prices for each item & rejects, invoicing for customers is simple.
      b.	This also allows customers to see prices before order is placed.
